                    </p>
                    <p>You can landscape the entire content, turning oceans into deserts if you want.  You build your own houses, fences, and kingdoms.  It is a completely open world.

                    </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest differences is that there is now a skill cloud verses the old style skill tree. It takes some getting used to but it has been enhanced with a search option making it fairly easy to find the tech you are looking for.

The games have had their ups and downs as all long running series do.  But it never fails to bring me back with with a new relealse or as my favorite fall back game.

                    <p><span class="htitle">League of Legends:</span><br/>Competitive online game, it is not an MMO even though there are thousands of people playing it. It allows you to setup two teams of either three or five players (including AI players) if you want to fight for a round.
                    </p>
                    <p>Depending on the style you choose rounds can last from 10 minutes to over an hour.  It has a very rich design feel and is well polished with new art being added very regularly.

I think the main draw for me is that the games are usually pretty quick, around 30 minutes.  It allows me to unwind from the day's stresses as well as interact with my kids.  There is enough variey and each game is against real people not just a computer AI to keep it interesting.

It has a great range of character types to choose from, as well as different starting locations for each.  The game has had many full feature package add-ons as well as having weekly updates.  They add new content regularly and are very quick to remove unseemly people and hackers alike.

I have been away from it now for almost 2 years but I am frequently asked by friends to return and once again enter the fray. The biggest issue I have with WOW is the sheer amount of time required to maintain your character's viability or edge. At this point in my life I just don't have the time needed to put into it.

                    <p><span class="htitle">Games:</span><br/>I have always enjoyed games with family and friends, but even from an early age I thought there was nothing better than computer games. For me those games have been nearly exclusively on the PC.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Over the years I have had several different consoles but always seem to gravitate back the PC game world. I occasionally still play board games with family and friends but nothing beats the immersion I get from the PC.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have played many different genres over the years and I seem to enjoy both RTS as well as MMOs nearly equally.  When a new MMO comes out I often join with several of my friends, but due to our different play times and even play styles the excitement usually only lasts for a few months before we are all back in our own little cycle of game time.
                    </p>
                    <p>When this happens I often fall back to one of my favorite RTS games like Civilization or X-COM.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="htitle">Wurm Online:</span><br/>Pros: Easy pace, full world manipulation, protected areas, non-linear, frequent updates.<br/>Cons: Hard to get started, monthly fee after lv 20, minimal questing.<br/>Overall: Monthly fee is negligible as you can make money in game and use it to pay the subscription.  Good looking game and regular updates. Worth playing if your game time is broken into small chunks.
