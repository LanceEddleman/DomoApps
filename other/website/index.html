					<p><span class="htitle">Website:</span><br/>Created for the Web Fundamentals class while working on my BSSD degree @WGU. This website is a depiction of my favorite hobbies reaching as far back as my early childhood when I first helped my friend copy the code for a game out of a magazine to play on his Commodore 64 computer.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="htitle">Games:</span><br/>I have always enjoyed games with family and friends, but even from an early age I thought there was nothing better than computer games. For me those games have been nearly exclusively on the PC. Over the years I have had several different consoles but always seem to gravitate back the PC game world. I occasionally still play board games with family and friends but nothing beats the immersion I get from the PC.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="htitle">Books:</span><br/>I wasn't always a reader, I did the occasional book report in school if I had to but never read on my own. I was nearly 24 before I picked up a book on my own and even then it was only to calm my nerves while flying for business trips. Apparently my hate for books was trumped my fear of falling, <em>from the sky!</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="htitle">TV Shows:</span><br/>Thanks to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon we have a wide variety to watch and access to all pass seasons, so that even if you just found a new favorite you wont miss a thing. After watching many shows I have decidedly become a huge fan of British based programs. I have seen a few of those shows redone by U.S. companies but they don't compare to the original and just become sad knock offs.
