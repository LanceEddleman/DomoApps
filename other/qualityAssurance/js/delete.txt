1) Whether a delete in the UI is a soft or hard delete
-- soft delete, add a deleted flag to the database.
2) Whether the user is prompted to confirm deletion with a red button and clear language
-- red button, information listed.
3) What if anything could be restored via a backend process and how (so card may be restored via a MySQL command upon request for example)
-- delete is design id pointer only, undelete removes the flag from database restoring app to last state. no additional changes needed.
4) Any considerations and notes (restoration of a card does not restore the previous permissions on that card, for example)
-- undelete removes the flag from database restoring app to last state.
5) Aspects that cannot be restored unless we add it to the roadmap in the future. Just so we can be clear with support
-- future: undelete from the UI, currently this can only be done via the CLI tool.
